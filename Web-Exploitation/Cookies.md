## Solution
We are given a link, which when opened shows a single text field and search button. When entering a cookie name, we are given a webpage with that name. However, if we look into the http check request using burpsuite, we see a cookie called "name", which is equal to a number corresponding with the cookie we sent. I chose chocolate chip, so the name value is 1.
```http
GET /check HTTP/1.1
Host: mercury.picoctf.net:6418
Cache-Control: max-age=0
Upgrade-Insecure-Requests: 1
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/117.0.5938.63 Safari/537.36

```
Editing this cookie and sending it back with varying numbers results in various corresponding webpages being shown, until we use the number 18, in which the flag is displayed rather than a cookie name!
