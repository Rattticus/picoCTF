## Solution
When opening the site, we are greeted with the message: "Only people who use the official PicoBrowser are allowed on this site!", and a gif of the kazoo kid (throwback!). My first thought was to edit the UserAgent field of the http request in order to appear to be using the "PicoBrowser". 
I used BurpSuite to re-forward the original connection request, this time with the UserAgent changed to "PicoBrowser":
```http
GET / HTTP/1.1
Host: mercury.picoctf.net:39114
Cache-Control: max-age=1
Upgrade-Insecure-Requests: 1
User-Agent: PicoBrowser
Accept: text/html,application/xhtml+xml,application/xml;q=0.9,image/avif,image/webp,image/apng,*/*;q=0.8,application/signed-exchange;v=b3;q=0.7
Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate, br
Accept-Language: en-US,en;q=0.9
```
This worked, and the page changed, but
